## Hello 👋

Hi, 
I am a doctoral student 👨‍🎓 at the [Department of Global Public Health](https://ki.se/en/gph/research/biostatistics-team) at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden. 
🔭 I am currently working on methods to impute missing values with external data in federated research settings.
📎 Have a look at the latest publication on [cross-site imputation in federated studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435625001532#:~:text=Cross%2Dsite%20imputation%20enables%20study,instead%20of%20individual%2Dlevel%20data.&text=The%20approach%20extends%20the%20classical,%2C%20federated%20multi%2Dcentre%20studies.).
