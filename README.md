## Hello 👋

Hi, I am a doctoral student 👨‍🎓 in biostatistics at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪.

The aim of my PhD is to investigate, evaluate, and develop statistical methods for the design, analysis, and interpretation of pooling projects. 
The project is supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Nicola Orsini](https://ki.se/en/people/nicola-orsini) and [Prof. Scott Hofer](https://www.phrei.org/investigators_Hofer.html).

🔭 We are currently working on methods to impute missing values with external data.

📍I am currently based in Boston, MA, USA :us:, where I do a 6-months research visit at the [TIMI Study Group](https://timi.org), Brigham and Women's Hospital.
