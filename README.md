## Hello 👋

Hi, 
I am a doctoral student 👨‍🎓 at the [Department of Global Public Health](https://ki.se/en/gph/research/biostatistics-team) at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden.I recently completed a research fellowship at the [TIMI Study Group](https://timi.org), Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, in Boston, USA.

The aim of my PhD is to investigate, evaluate, and develop statistical methods for the design, analysis, and interpretation of pooling projects. 
The project is supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Nicola Orsini](https://ki.se/en/people/nicola-orsini) and [Prof. Scott Hofer](https://www.phrei.org/investigators_Hofer.html).

🔭 We are currently working on methods to impute missing values with external data.

📎 Have a look at the latest publication on [cross-site imputation in federated studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435625001532#:~:text=Cross%2Dsite%20imputation%20enables%20study,instead%20of%20individual%2Dlevel%20data.&text=The%20approach%20extends%20the%20classical,%2C%20federated%20multi%2Dcentre%20studies.).
